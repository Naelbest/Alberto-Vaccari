                                    <h3>So, how did he start photography?</h3>
									<p>He started photography in 2009, after leaving his home country (Italy); at the beginning it was just to show his parents and friends where he has been as well as to keep track of his experiences.</p>
                                    <p>Later on, he found myself fascinated by photography itself, not only as a mean to convey information but also feelings and sensations.
                                    Slowly it became somehow part of his daily habits and now he would not imagine himself without a camera around.</p>
                                    <h3>Fun fact</h3>
                                    <p>The moment where he felt the most in "danger" during his travels ended up staying overnight with a bunch of cool African bus drivers in a room with only 3 mattresses eating bread and butter and smoking together.</p>
